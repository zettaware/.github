Greetings and welcome to Zetta! We always like to make useful things for people on the internet and we have been doing this since the **29th May, 2022** 🤯 Thats when we created this account.

<!--
**Here are some ideas to get you started:**
🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
